You can use your finger on the screen to manipulate them. If you need assistance, ask the TA. Please navigate with the bookmark or flip back to the very first page (Interactive 1.1) for the next person when you are done.\nAnswer the following questions from your observation and reading of the models in the iBook: 1. What other elements are present in the mineral structure of Feldspars that are not present in Quartz?\n\nBased on what you know about the stability of the cation-oxygen bonds in the BIG 8 (Lecture 1.5), do you think Feldspars are more or less stable (or resistant to weathering) than Quartz?\nIn the phyllosilicates, how are the Si-tetrahedral sheets and Al-octahedral sheets linked?\nWhy is kaolinite called a 1:1 clay mineral?\nWhy are Micas called 2:1 clay minerals?\nWhat occupies the space between layers in Mica or Illite?\nAre there any other atoms besides Si in the tetrahedral sheets of a Mica or Illite? If so what element?\n\nNote how water (WAT) and other cations (in this case Na) occupy the interlayer of the Vermiculites and Smectites. Unlike Kaolinite and Micas/Illites, Vermiculite/Smectites are shrinking and swelling (or expanding) clays because they have a weak enough negative charge that hydrated ions and water can enter the interlayer space. Smectites can expand even more than vermiculites because they have a lower negative charge so the positively charged cations that hold the layers together are few and the layers can disperse far apart."

The deionized H2O contains no cations, the NaCl solution contains Na+ ions, and the AlCl3 solution contains Al3+ ions.\nWait 5 minutes and watch each tube for the formation of colloids (clay particles held together by electrical attraction to an ion) – when they form, you should be able to see them with your naked eye.

    "text": "1.1 INVESTIGATION A: Using a Hydrometer to Determine Particle Size\n\n1.1.1 Theory\nParticle size distribution has become a standard means for characterizing and classifying the fine earth fraction of solid soil particles, and is used to determine the soil texture class. This experiment uses a Bouyoucos hydrometer to measure the density (grams per L) of a liquid mixture (“slurry”) of soil and water.\nUsing the hydrometer allows us to determine soil texture by measuring the grams of the soil particles (sand, silt, and, clay) that remain suspended in the cylinder after a specific period of time. Different sized soil particles are separated by their different sedimentation rates – e.g. larger particles will settle faster in a column of water, while smaller particles remain suspended much longer in the solution (based on Stokes Law).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch this video before you start Investigation A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Preparation\nThe two cylinders in this investigation each contain 60 grams of oven-dry dispersed soil – one soil is from an E horizon and one is from a B horizon. After mixing thoroughly with a stir stick, the largest particles (sand) will quickly drop to the bottom of the cylinder. After 40 seconds, only silt and clay particles are left suspended in the water. After two hours only clay-sized particles remain.\nExample of a citation Knuth (1984). testing inline citation (Knuth 1984).\n\n\n1.1.3 Measurements\n\n1.1.3.1 40 Second Measurement\n\nCarefully use the stirring rod (approximately 18 inches long with a disk on the end) to completely disperse the soil in the cylinder. This requires that you slowly lower and lift the stirring rod up and down in the cylinder until all the sediment is removed from the bottom of the cylinder.\nAfter stirring, immediately note the time to the nearest second. Carefully and slowly insert the hydrometer (the hydrometers are extremely fragile) into the cylinder. Please refer to the figure on page 2. (Note: you may need to use your finger to stop the hydrometer from bobbing).\nAfter 40 seconds, read the number (at liquid level) on the hydrometer.\nThis reading must be corrected for temperature. Add 0.4 g/L for each degree above 20ºCelcius or subtract 0.4 g/L for each degree below 20ºCelcius.\n\n\n\n1.1.3.2 2 Hour Measurement\n\nDue to time constraints, two hour readings will be provided in lab.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Hydrometer Process\n\n\n(Note: The soil in the diagram has (60-30)/60 x 100= 50% Sand; 10/60 x100= 17% Clay; 100-50-17=33% Silt)\n\n\n1.1.3.3 Calculations - note: correct readings before calculating sand, silt, and clay!\n\\[\nSand (\\%) = \\frac{M_{sample,ovendry} - 40s reading}{M_{sample,ovendry}} x 100%\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3.4 Results\nnote just trying to cut out tables to see if that works\n\n\n\n\nHydrometer Measurement Results\n \n  \n    Measurements \n    Sample 1 \n    Sample 2 \n  \n \n\n  \n    Sample mass (oven-dry) \n    60 g \n    60 g \n  \n  \n    40s reading (uncorrected \n    g/L \n    g/L \n  \n  \n    Temperature (C) \n    g/L \n    g/L \n  \n  \n    40s reading (corrected) \n    C \n    C \n  \n  \n    % Sand \n    % \n    % \n  \n  \n    2hr reading (uncorrected) \n    g/L \n    g/L \n  \n  \n    Temperature @2hr (C) \n    C \n    C \n  \n  \n    2hr readng (corrected) \n    g/L \n    g/L \n  \n  \n    % Clay \n    % \n    % \n  \n  \n    % Silt \n    % \n    %"

The USDA textural triangle is used to classify the texture class of a soil. The sides of the soil textural triangle are scaled for the percentages of sand, silt, and clay (0-100%). Clay percentages are read along the lines from left to right across the triangle. Silt is read along the lines from the upper right to lower left. Sand along the lines from lower right to the upper left portion of the triangle. The intersections of the three sides on the triangle give the texture class name. For instance, if you have a soil with 20% clay, 45% silt, and 35% sand it falls in the “loam” textural class name.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: USDA Soil Texture Triangle\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Results\nUsing the soil particle percent data from Investigation A determine the texture class for the soil samples 1 and 2.\n\n\n\n\nKnuth, Donald E. 1984. “Literate Programming.” Comput.
